Great! We’ll start with HTML and make sure you fully understand everything before moving on.

📌 Step 1: HTML – Mastering the Fundamentals

Since you know some tags but not their full usage, we’ll go through important concepts + exercises so you actually apply what you learn.


---

📝 1. HTML Structure & Semantic Elements

🔹 What You Need to Know:
✔ What is Semantic HTML?
✔ Why should you use <header>, <section>, <article>, etc.?
✔ How does it improve SEO & Accessibility?

🔍 Example: Bad vs Good HTML

🚫 Bad HTML (Non-Semantic)

<div class="header"></div>
<div class="content">
  <div class="post"></div>
</div>
<div class="footer"></div>

✅ Good HTML (Semantic)

<header></header>
<main>
  <article></article>
</main>
<footer></footer>

🔹 Task: Create a basic webpage using only semantic elements (header, nav, section, article, footer).

📝 2. Forms & Input Elements (Super Important)

🔹 What You Need to Know:
✔ Input types (text, email, password, number, etc.)
✔ Form validation (required, minlength, maxlength, pattern)
✔ Buttons (submit, reset, button)

🔍 Example: Login Form

<form>
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" required>

  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" minlength="6" required>

  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>

🔹 Task: Build a registration form with name, email, password, gender (radio buttons), and a submit button.

📝 3. Tables & Accessibility

🔹 What You Need to Know:
✔ How to create tables (<table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, <td>, <th>)
✔ Table accessibility (scope, aria-label)
✔ When to use tables vs divs?

🔍 Example: Basic Table

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
      <th>City</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Raj</td>
      <td>22</td>
      <td>Delhi</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

🔹 Task: Create a product pricing table with at least 3 rows and 3 columns.

📝 4. SEO Basics (Making HTML Search-Engine Friendly)

🔹 What You Need to Know:
✔ meta tags (title, description, keywords, viewport)
✔ Open Graph tags (for social media sharing)
✔ Image SEO (using alt tags)

🔍 Example: SEO-Friendly Page

<head>
  <title>Best Clothing Brand | Loomed Charm</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Get premium abayas and hijabs at the best prices.">
  <meta name="keywords" content="abaya, hijab, modest fashion">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>

🔹 Task: Add proper SEO meta tags to your previous tasks.
